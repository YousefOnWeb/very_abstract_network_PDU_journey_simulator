# very_abstract_network_PDU_journey_simulator
A visual interactive tool that -very abstractly- mimics packet/frame traversal dynamics as per very fundamental computer networking concepts. The main goal is to enable the user to observe the traversal of an abstract PDU (like a frame or a packet). You can see it as a simple solver of basic/classic networking PDU traversal/behavior problems.
